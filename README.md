# FocusFlow – Front-End To-Do Practice Lab

This is a to-do application I built to practice and demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project began with simple static files and evolved into the full-featured app you see today, which I've designed to be a useful tool for developers.

> ✨ I built this app to solve a personal need: tracking my notes and tasks from my Linux practice sessions. It's designed to help capture commands, summarize learnings, and manage a personal learning backlog.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Modern UX:** responsive glassmorphism design, accessible controls, keyboard-friendly dialog editing.
- **Smart productivity:** filters, search, overdue highlighting, and completion analytics keep you focused on outcomes.
- **Reliable data:** tasks persist in `localStorage` and sync across tabs via the Storage API.
- **Extensible foundation:** modular JavaScript ready to plug into APIs, GitHub Issues, or static exports.

## 🧪 Live Demo Locally

1. Open `modern-todo-app/index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Add tasks, capture session notes, and test the filters, search, and edit dialog.
3. Refresh the page—your tasks persist thanks to `localStorage`.

> Tip: Record a quick Loom or GIF while interacting with the UI for your portfolio.

The `archive/` directory preserves the learning journey from raw HTML to a polished app—useful when discussing growth with recruiters.

## 📈 Roadmap Ideas

- Sync tasks with a backend (Supabase/Firebase) and add multi-device support.
- Export completed sessions into Markdown (or push straight into another repo).
- Deploy the UI to GitHub Pages and embed it in your portfolio.
- Layer on component tests with Playwright or Cypress.
