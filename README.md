# FocusFlow – Front-End To-Do Practice Lab

A polished to-do application that showcases deliberate practice across HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project started as simple static exercises and evolved into a production-ready experience that recruiters can explore quickly.

> ✨ Built while pairing Linux server practice with UI engineering: track Segfault sessions, capture commands, and keep your learning backlog organized.

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Modern UX:** responsive glassmorphism design, accessible controls, keyboard-friendly dialog editing.
- **Smart productivity:** filters, search, overdue highlighting, and completion analytics keep you focused on outcomes.
- **Reliable data:** tasks persist in `localStorage` and sync across tabs via the Storage API.
- **Extensible foundation:** modular JavaScript ready to plug into APIs, GitHub Issues, or static exports.

## 🧪 Live Demo Locally

1. Open `modern-todo-app/index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Add tasks, capture session notes, and test the filters, search, and edit dialog.
3. Refresh the page—your tasks persist thanks to `localStorage`.

> Tip: Record a quick Loom or GIF while interacting with the UI for your portfolio.

## 📈 Roadmap Ideas

- Sync tasks with a backend (Supabase/Firebase) and add multi-device support.
- Export completed sessions into Markdown (or push straight into another repo).
- Deploy the UI to GitHub Pages and embed it in your portfolio.
- Layer on component tests with Playwright or Cypress.
