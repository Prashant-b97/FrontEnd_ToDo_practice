# Learning Archive

This folder preserves the early iterations of the to-do project. It demonstrates the progression from static markup to interactive JavaScript experiments before consolidating everything into the modern `FocusFlow` app.

- `StaticTodo/` – raw HTML exercises exploring semantic markup and simple layouts.
- `StaticToDowithStylE/` – styling explorations, experimenting with CSS organization and improved UI states.
- `Javascriptcuminnin/` – JavaScript drills covering DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic interactivity.

Feel free to open these files in the browser to see the incremental evolution.
